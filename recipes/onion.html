    <h3>French Onion Soup is a soul-warming delight. Caramelized onions in a rich beef broth, topped with melted cheese and a toasted baguette, create a harmonious blend of savory flavors and comforting textures.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white or red wine (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Baguette slices, toasted</li>
        <li>Gruyère or Swiss cheese, grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the butter and olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until they caramelize and turn a deep golden brown color, around 30-40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the onions are caramelized, pour in the wine (if using) to deglaze the pot, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom.</li>
        <li>Add the beef broth, chicken broth, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, salt, and pepper to the pot.</li>
        <li>Bring the soup to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer gently for about 20-30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven broiler. Ladle the soup into oven-safe bowls placed on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Top each bowl of soup with a toasted baguette slice and sprinkle generously with grated Gruyère or Swiss cheese.</li>
        <li>Place the baking sheet with the soup bowls under the broiler for 2-3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, watching carefully to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Remove the soup bowls from the oven and allow the soup to cool for a minute before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy the comforting goodness of homemade French Onion Soup!</li>
    </ol>
